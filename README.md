### TweetBlock
TweetBlock is licensed under the MIT license, the basic gist of this license is: do whatever you want, just don't hold me liable.

For the Twitter API code, I use the [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/) Java library. It's licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

More details on the licenses can be found in the LICENSE file.

###Dependencies
The Java code relies on [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/) to communicate with the Twitter API, the library can be downloaded at [twitter4j-3.0.5.zip](http://twitter4j.org/archive/twitter4j-3.0.5.zip).
After downloading the file, add twitter4j-core-3.0.5.jar to the project build path.
